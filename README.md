## Background and motivation

The inspiration for smala came from the [Memory](https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/) feature of ChatGPT, where the chatbot will remember important pieces of information across your conversations.
I wanted to explore how we can have similar functionality that is independent of what service or language model you use
